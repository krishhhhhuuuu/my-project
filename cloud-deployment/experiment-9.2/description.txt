# Experiment 9.2 — CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions

## Objective

To understand and implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions.
This experiment automates the process of building and testing a simple Node.js project whenever new code is pushed to the repository, demonstrating the basics of workflow automation in DevOps.

## Description

This experiment demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow that automates building and testing of a simple Node.js project.
Whenever a new commit is pushed to the repository, the pipeline automatically runs the following steps:

1. Checkout Repository – Clones the latest code from GitHub.
2. Setup Node.js – Installs Node.js in the workflow runner.
3. Install Dependencies – Installs project dependencies using npm.
4. Run Build – Executes the build command defined in `package.json`.
5. Run Tests – Executes the test script.

### 3. .github/workflows/main.yml

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

---

## Flow of Execution

1. Push Code to GitHub:
   When code is pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions automatically triggers the pipeline.

2. Workflow Execution:
   The steps in `main.yml` run sequentially — checking out code, installing dependencies, and running build/test scripts.

3. Build and Test Logs:
   Each step’s result (success or failure) is displayed in the GitHub Actions tab of the repository.

4. Pipeline Status:

   * ✅ Green Tick: All steps executed successfully.
   * ❌ Red Cross: Some steps failed (e.g., build or test errors).

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Understood how GitHub Actions automates CI/CD workflows.
* Learned to define and structure workflows in YAML format.
* Understood each stage of a build–test pipeline.
* Gained hands-on experience with Node.js scripts in automation.
* Learned how to debug pipeline failures using GitHub Actions logs.

## Commands Used

```bash
# Initialize Node.js project
npm init -y

# Run build command
npm run build

# Run test command
npm test
```

---

## Result

The CI/CD pipeline was successfully implemented using GitHub Actions.
Upon each push to the repository, the workflow automatically built and tested the Node.js project, displaying the results directly in the Actions tab — demonstrating the power of automation in modern software development.
