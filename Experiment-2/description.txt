Title: Responsive Banking UI with Deposit/Withdrawal Buttons and Balance Display.

Tools and Technologies Used:
-> HTML5
-> CSS (Flex)

Description:
-> I created a visually appealing banking user interface using HTML and CSS.
-> For this i personally used CSS flex to center align the elements.
-> A card layout is created to neatly contain and organize all the interface elements.
-> The interface includes a balance display along with Deposit and Withdraw buttons, all styled for clarity and usability.
-> Using Flexbox, the design adapts smoothly to all screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile.
-> The HTML file is linked to an external CSS file using the <link> tag to separate structure from styling and ensure clean, maintainable code.

Scenarios:
1. Layout: The design adapts smoothly on both desktop and mobile screens using Flexbox.
2. Card Container: All elements (balance and buttons) are neatly organized inside a centered card layout.
3. Button Styling: Deposit and Withdraw buttons are wide, clearly colored, and easy to use.
4. Balance Display: The balance is clearly visible in green with a large, readable font.

Learning Outcomes:
-> Understand how to center content using Flexbox.
-> Learn how to create card-based UI components with shadows and padding.
-> Develop a clean and structured user interface without interactivity.
