# 🧾 Project Description — Fine-Grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using MERN Stack

## 🔹 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Fine-Grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
The application manages user permissions and access rights based on assigned roles (Admin, Editor, and Viewer) to ensure secure and structured control over both frontend and backend operations.

Each role is granted specific privileges:

* Admin — Full control: can manage users and posts.
* Editor — Can create and edit only their own posts.
* Viewer — Has read-only access.

The project integrates JWT-based authentication, role-aware authorization, and React route protection to create a secure and responsive web application.

---

## 🔹 Objective

To design and implement a secure, full-stack web application that controls access to resources based on user roles and permissions, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot perform restricted actions.

---

## 🔹 Key Features

* User Authentication: Login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* Role-Based Authorization: Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles with defined permissions.
* Admin Panel: Admins can view, add, and delete users.
* Ownership Control: Editors can only update their own content.
* Frontend UI Guards: React components and routes adapt based on user roles.
* Secure Passwords: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
* Validation: Input fields validated using `express-validator`.
* Session Management: Logout clears tokens and prevents unauthorized access.

## 🔹 System Workflow

1. User Login: A user logs in and receives a JWT token stored in localStorage.
2. Authorization Check: Each API route validates the token and checks user role using middleware.
3. Frontend Control: React uses `AuthProvider` and `PrivateRoute` to restrict access.
4. Admin Panel: Admins can manage users (add/delete) and assign roles.
5. Role Enforcement: Editors can update only their posts; Viewers can only read.
6. Logout: Clears session and redirects to login securely.

## 🔹 Results

* The system successfully enforces role-based permissions across all modules.
* Admins can manage users, while Editors and Viewers operate within their allowed limits.
* Unauthorized access to routes or actions is blocked at both backend and frontend.
* The UI adapts dynamically based on logged-in user roles.
