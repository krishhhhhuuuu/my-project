ADMIN DASHBOARD - DARK MODE TOGGLE EXPERIMENT

1. OBJECTIVE:
   To design and implement an admin dashboard layout using HTML and CSS Grid, with a theme toggle functionality
   that switches between light mode and dark mode using CSS variables and a hidden checkbox.

2. FUNCTIONALITY DESCRIPTION:
   - Default Theme Variables:
     The :root selector defines CSS variables for background color, text color, header/footer color, sidebar color, and link color.
     These variables are used across the layout to maintain consistent styling.

   - Dark Mode Variables:
     When the #theme-toggle checkbox is checked, new variable values are applied to .dashboard using the sibling selector (~).
     This changes background, text, and element colors to a dark mode palette.

   - Layout Grid:
     The dashboard uses CSS Grid with three main areas:
       * Header (top)
       * Sidebar (left)
       * Main content (right)
       * Footer (bottom)
     The grid-template-areas property defines the layout structure.

   - Header & Footer:
     Both are styled with a background color (from variables), white text, and flexbox for spacing and alignment.
     The header contains the dashboard title and a label that toggles the dark mode.

   - Sidebar:
     Placed on the left, styled with a background from the sidebar variable.
     Contains a list of navigation links styled with the link variable.

   - Main Content:
     Displays a welcome message and placeholder text for admin content such as charts, tables, or reports.

3. HTML STRUCTURE:
   - Hidden checkbox (#theme-toggle) for toggling themes.
   - .dashboard container holding:
       * <header> with title and dark mode toggle label.
       * <nav> sidebar with navigation menu.
       * <main> for content display.
       * <footer> for copyright.

4. SCENARIO:
   Imagine an organization where administrators need to monitor users, settings, and analytics from a single interface.
   During day hours, the light theme is preferred for better visibility in bright environments.
   At night or in low-light conditions, the dark theme reduces eye strain.
   The theme toggle feature allows quick switching without reloading the page.
   This dashboard can be extended with charts, logs, and interactive data panels while keeping the theme consistent.

5. LEARNING OUTCOMES:
   1. How to use CSS variables for theming.
   2. How to implement light/dark mode toggles using a hidden checkbox and sibling selectors.
   3. How to create a responsive admin layout using CSS Grid.
   4. How to style components consistently using global variables.

6. TEST CASES:
   - Default load shows light theme.
   - Checking the toggle changes to dark theme.
   - Links change color according to theme.
   - Background and text colors update across all sections consistently.
